# Ghost Game

I wrote this simple CLI Ghost Game as I worked through the App Academy Open curriculum at https://www.aaonline.io/. This full stack programming course is free for anyone who is interested!

Ghost is word game, and when you lose a round you gain a letter in Ghost (kind of like the scoring in Horse if you were playing basketball). 

There is an explanation of the game on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(game), but it's easier to understand by watching a video: https://youtu.be/-h9owfIOoIQ

To play the game you'll need to have Ruby 2.2 or higher installed on your computer.

1. Open the Terminal and navigate to the folder where you've saved the Ghost Game files.
2. To start use the command> ruby 'play_ghost.rb'
3. Win by forcing the other player to make a complete word. 5 times! (GHOST)

Good luck!
